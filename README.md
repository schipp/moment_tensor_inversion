# Moment Tensor Inversion (DC-space grid search)

Invert for the moment tensor of an (regional) earthquake by grid-searching the double-couple parameter space (strike, dip, rake) and comparing synthetic waveforms (computed) with recorded seismograms at each grid-point. Waveform-similarity is estimated by a combination of L1- and L2-norm. This code has been used in Schippkus et al. [(2019)](http://doi.org/10.17738/ajes.2019.0010) to determine the moment tensor of the $M_L$ 4.2 Alland 2016 main shock.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Relevant base Green's Functions for applicable event-station-distances (ZSS, ZDS, ZDD, RSS, RDS, RDD, TSS, TDS). E.g., **C**omputer **P**rograms in **S**eismology by Herrmann [(2013)](http://www.eas.slu.edu/eqc/eqccps.html).

## TODO

- [ ] Move settings to external config file
- [ ] Document properly
- [ ] Add visualization scripts
